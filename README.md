# Armeno-Turkish corpus construction

The aim of this workflow is to discover works in the HathiTrust Digital Library that are written in historic and hybrid languages with nonstandard language and script combinations. Finding such works through the HathiTrust search functionality present challenges, such as OCR errors, misrepresentation of volume and binding information, mislabeling due to cataloging practices that donâ€™t consider the language as distinct from the script, and possibly more. To address these challenges, we have designed an open experimental workflow to discover such corpora in the HathiTrust library by training and applying a machine learning model to assist in discovering texts of languages whose histories are laden with mislabeling and miscategorization through the test case of Armeno-Turkish: vernacular Turkish written in the Armenian script.  

We compare a trigram character language model, a simple and performant approach to language identification, with a FastText language identification model trained on our labeled dataset. Finally, we apply our best performing model, the trained FastText model with a 0.91 fscore on the test set, to all documents in the HTC tagged as Turkish (tur), Ottoman Turkish (ota), or Armenian (arm).
